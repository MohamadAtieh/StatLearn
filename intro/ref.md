#1.2.R2

###True or False: The goal of any supervised learning study is to be able to predict the response very accurately.

- False

	- Explanation:  Most supervised learning problems can be framed formally in terms of predicting a response, but prediction alone is often not the main goal of the analysis. For example, many applications of linear regression in the sciences are aimed primarily at understanding how the inputs of a system drive the outputs; an extremely complicated "black box" giving pure predictions would not be very useful in and of itself.
